Remember to periodically update library definitions
by doing a:

    $ flow-typed install
    
or:

    $ flow-typed install --overwrite

NB: it is possible that flow-typed may not be declared in the
    development dependencies in [package.json], this may be because
    it was globally installed with:

    $ sudo npm install -g flow-typed
